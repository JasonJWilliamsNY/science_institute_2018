The fall half of the course will give a broad introduction of the skills in modern molecular biology. Students will cover basic experiments and techniques in molecular biology. As their knowledge increases, their methodological insights will be put into appropriate scientific context.\n\n\nSkills:\n Students should hope to understand the following subject areas:\n\n Understanding of the \u201cscientific\u201d method\n\n Ability to independently design and critique experiments\n\n Ability to do independent research\n\n Awareness of current advances, and issues in science\n\n How to find scientific mentors and get started on summer research projects\n\n The basic techniques of the modern biological laboratory.\n\n\nClass Materials:\n Students are expected to come prepared to each class\n\n\n\n\nNotebook or loose-leaf binder for in-class notes\n\n\nA laboratory notebook (marble notebook)\n\n\n\n\nTests/Grades:\n We will have quizzes monthly at the start of class. These will be posted on the calendar.

Students are \nexpected to check their email at least weekly\n, and check the website for handouts and assignments. The school provides email accounts to all students who need them.\n\n\nQuestions/Absences/Class cancellations:\n I will call the main office for cancellation due to weather or emergency.
